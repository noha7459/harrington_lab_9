The extensions I added are:
  - Make the game boring; after 2 levels the sprites for enemies, platforms, and background disapear and revert to simple shapes.
  - Added difficulty; more enemies added to levels 3-5.
  - Made accessing levels 3-5 harder; players now have to solve an algebra equation before accessing the4 level.
  - Added a volume slider in the pause and start menu.
  - Added a color blindness option in both the start and pause menu.
